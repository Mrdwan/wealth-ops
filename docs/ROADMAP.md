---

## 🟢 Phase 2A: Momentum Composite (NEW — Academic Baseline)
> **Goal:** Deploy the academically-backed momentum signal FIRST as the baseline. This runs before XGBoost and provides a signal even without ML.

- [x] **Step 2A.1: Base Technical Feature Engine.**
  - `FeatureEngine` class with 11 base indicators: RSI(14), EMA_8/20/50, MACD Histogram, ADX(14), ATR(14), Upper/Lower Wick Ratios, EMA Fan, Distance from 20d Low.
  - Edge case: `(High - Low) == 0` → both wick ratios = `0.0`.
  - Profile-agnostic: 11 features computed for every asset.

- [x] **Step 2A.2: Class-Specific Features.**
  - OBV + Volume Ratio: only when `volume_features = true` (EQUITY).
  - Relative Strength: z-scored `asset_close / benchmark_close` ratio. Benchmark per profile (SPY for equities, UUP for commodities).
  - Feature count: 14 (EQUITY), 12 (COMMODITY_HAVEN/FOREX).

- [ ] **Step 2A.3: Momentum Composite Score.**
  - Implement 6-component composite: Momentum (40%), Trend (20%), RSI (15%), Volume (10%), ATR Volatility (10%), Support/Resistance (5%).
  - All components z-score normalized before weighting.
  - Volume component skipped for `volume_features = false` assets, weights redistribute.
  - Thresholds: STRONG_BUY >2.0σ, BUY >1.5σ, NEUTRAL ±1.5σ, SELL <-1.5σ.

- [ ] **Step 2A.4: Momentum Signal Cards.**
  - Telegram signal delivery with entry zones, stop loss, TP, position size, reasoning.
  - Cards include composite score breakdown (which components contribute most).
  - Trap Order parameters calculated and included.

- [ ] **Step 2A.5: Market-Level Data Integration.**
  - VIX, SPY, DXY data flowing into signal pipeline.
  - Staleness policy enforced: >24h stale → guard defaults to FAIL, Telegram alert.

## 🔴 Phase 2B: The XGBoost Alpha Specialist (Evolved from v2 Phase 2)
> **Goal:** Add XGBoost per-asset models ON TOP of the momentum baseline. Compare their performance independently.

- [ ] **Step 2B.1: Earnings Calendar Integration (EQUITY Only).**
  - Source: Tiingo Fundamentals or Alpha Vantage earnings calendar.
  - Store `next_earnings_date` per equity asset. Refresh daily.
  - Only for assets with `event_guard = true`.

- [ ] **Step 2B.2: Economic Calendar Integration (COMMODITY/FOREX).** ← NEW
  - Source: FRED + Finnhub free API.
  - Track FOMC meeting dates, NFP release dates, CPI releases.
  - Store `next_macro_event_date` for `macro_event_guard = true` assets.
  - Guard: `Days_to_FOMC/NFP >= 2`.

- [ ] **Step 2B.3: The "One-Asset, One-Model" Pipeline.**
  - Fargate Task: Pull data → Read profile → Compute feature vector → Train XGBoost → Save to S3.
  - Target: `High > Close + 3%` within 5 trading days.
  - Feature vector: determined by profile (14 or 12 features).
  - Calibration: Platt Scaling post-training. Validate per profile class.

- [ ] **Step 2B.4: Dual Signal Comparison.**
  - Run Momentum Composite AND XGBoost in parallel.
  - Log both scores for every asset every day (even when no signal fires).
  - Signal cards show both: "Momentum: 1.9σ | XGBoost: 82%".
  - See ARCHITECTURE.md Section 7 for agreement matrix.

  - t-statistic > 2.0 required for signal significance.
  - Red flags: Sharpe > 3.0, Profit Factor > 2.5, Max DD < 5%, Win Rate > 75%.
  - If any red flag triggers: review, do not deploy.

- [ ] **Step 2.5.5: Calibration Validation.**
  - Reliability diagrams per profile class.
  - If calibration curve deviates >10% from diagonal at 0.75 threshold → recalibrate.

- [ ] **Step 2.5.6: Cross-Class Portfolio Sim.**
  - Test mixed portfolios: 2 equities + 1 Gold (XAU/USD).
  - Validate diversification benefit of RISK_ON + RISK_OFF positions.
  - Run with both Momentum-only AND Momentum+XGBoost to measure ML's marginal contribution.

- [ ] **Step 2.5.7: Paper Trading Gate.**
  - Minimum 3 months, minimum 30 trades.
  - Live results within 1σ of backtest.
  - Slippage < 0.3%. Miss rate < 20%.

## Timeline Estimate (Solo Dev, ~1hr/day + weekends)

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 (remaining) | 2 weeks | Week 2 | Tiingo Forex + FRED data flowing, two-way Telegram |
| 2A | 3 weeks | Week 5 | Momentum signals live, paper trading begins |
| 2B | 3 weeks | Week 8 | XGBoost models trained, dual-signal comparison |
| 2.5 | 3 weeks | Week 11 | Backtesting validated (walk-forward + Monte Carlo) |
| 3 | 4 weeks | Week 15 | Full pipeline: signal → guards → risk → notify |
| 4 | 3 weeks | Week 18 | Regime classifier (deploy only if proven) |
| 5 | 3+ months | Month 7+ | Paper trading complete, live with HALF sizes |

**Key gates:** Phase 2.5 can BLOCK Phase 3 activation for failing profile classes. Phase 5.1 can BLOCK live trading if paper results diverge.
