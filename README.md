## 📖 The Mission
Wealth-Ops is not a "get rich quick" bot. It is a **Capital Preservation & Swing Trading Engine** designed to solve three specific problems for the individual investor in Ireland:

1.  **The Tax Trap:** Avoids ETFs (41% Deemed Disposal Tax) in favor of Direct Indexing (Individual Stocks @ 33% CGT).
2.  **The Fee Shark:** Enforces minimum trade sizes (€2k+) to minimize commission drag.
3.  **The Emotional Gap:** Uses an "AI Committee" to separate mathematical signal from human panic.

## 🧠 The Architecture (The Committee)

The system operates as a distributed "Committee of Agents" on AWS:

1.  **🛡️ The Regime Filter (Circuit Breaker):**
    * *Logic:* "Don't catch a falling knife."
    * *Role:* Checks S&P 500 vs. 200-day MA. If Bear Market, **hard block** on all buys.
2.  **🔭 The Scout (Data):**
    * *Role:* Fetches Daily Candles (Yahoo) and News Sentiment (RSS/APIs).
3.  **🎯 The Alpha Specialist (Math):**
    * *Core Tech:* XGBoost (One Model Per Asset).
    * *Strategy:* **"The Swing Sniper"** - Predicts if `High > Close + 3%` within 5 days.
4.  **⚖️ The Judge (Synthesis):**
    * *Role:* An LLM (Gemini/Claude) that reads the Specialist's math and the Scout's news to issue a final **Buy/Hold/Sell** verdict.
